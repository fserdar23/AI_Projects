    "\n",
    "Reviews provide objective feedback to a product and are therefore inherently useful for consumers. These ratings are often summarized by a numerical rating, or the number of stars. Of course there is more value in the actual text itself than the quantified stars. And at times, the given rating does not truly convey the experience of the product – the heart of the feedback is actually in the text itself. The goal therefore is to build a classifier that would understand the essence of a piece of review and assign it the most appropriate rating based on the meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4 align=\"center\">Background</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though product ratings on Amazon are aggregated from all the reviews by every customer, each individual rating is actually only an integer that ranges from one star to five stars. This reduces our predictions to discrete classes totaling five possibilities. Therefore what we'll have is a supervised, multi-class classifier with the actual review text as the core predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is an exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of predicting the star rating given a piece of text will take on different NLP topics including word embedding, topic modeling, and dimension reduction. From there, we'll arrive at a final dataframe and we'll be employing different machine learning techniques in order to come up with the best approach (i.e. most accurate estimator) for our classifier.\n",

    "The [Amazon dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/index.html) contains the customer reviews for all listed *Electronics* products spanning from May 1996 up to July 2014. There are a total of 1,689,188 reviews by a total of 192,403 customers on 63,001 unique products. The data dictionary is as follows:\n",

Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that\\'s just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!'"

       " ' this review sounds pretty positive to begin with but trust the second line too burnt out on this crap hardware to rewrite this whole mess do not purchase this receiver you have been warned now you can read over the restim starting to get used to this receiver finally i was about to throw it in the yard yesterday it sounds awesome and i have been very impressed with the noticeable improvement in sound quality over my very dated old receiver its big downfall is the complexity of just about everything you have to do i spent  hours trying to get audio return channel working yep i even set it up correctly i finally power cycled it and bam off it went and started working i spent another hour trying to figure out why the automatic sound setup basically turned off my subwoofer never actually figured it out i reset the damn receiver im not really keen on needing to get my receiver degree grrrrthen there is the weird crap you are slapping buttons on the remote hoping it finally does what the exhausting pdf manual states it should be sure to hit the receiver button repeatedly and pray to the onkyo goddess before attempting to do something important some weirdness with the powering on of my blue ray player also but its like an annoying girlfriend with a hot body you cant help yourself and keep coming back for more cuz when its working its just plain sexy my complaints are long winded but when i put in the avengers br disk and the tesseract rumbles my walls ceiling and floor in a very realistic way well i just want to giggle that and music ive had for years sounds almost new i can hear subtleties i never heard before impressiveone star off for me having to purchase tversity because i cant access the nas on my windows  server domain controller nor stream media via media services everything else is now working though knocks on wood heres hoping that in  days i dont see a mini mushroom cloud as some electrical component gives up the ghost update i was finally able to use the home media option from the net page onkyos continuous excuse is that it was meant for a samba type of environment and they say specifically apple computers using a generic account i was able to get it to work on windows server  enterprise by enabling the guest account and putting guest on the share permissions and ntfs permissions as read only also had to enable netbios on the adapter and the computer browser service older windows environments hence why samba works used netbios to enumerate the servers and services they offered on the network newer windows servers use dns and the reason nothing may show up i was very happy to get this going because the dlna service i was running streamed the music with added bass and less clarity even though i told it not to compress modify etc the streamed media now via home media my music is just as sharp via the network server as it was coming form a usb deviceive also since replaced my existing speakers with polk audio monitors b for front c center b front high rm surround and a polk powered subwoofer for  now one of my forms of entertainment is to play some classical and pick out the instruments no to be cliche but im no audiophile here in a comparison to alcohol from beer to fine wine im the kind of guy that would purchase  bottle of wine but consider a  plus bottle as wasted on me too close to vinegar imho and not near a delicate enough palate to appreciate so this stereo sounds damn good to me for the money i can play adeles lovesong and the bass is like being tamped in the chest with a x yet the voice is still clear me likes the older lady that lives in the house next to me is giving me hard looks lately thoughon a side note when it was setup i put it on an apc ups battery backed up power power strip being a network infrastructure guy by trade network administrator ive seen dirty power fry a lot of equipment dont know if this is helping the amp live a happy life or not but i always put things i want to keep running on a ups i also made sure it had plenty of room to breath i was going to squeeze it into a smaller spot but after feeling the heat it put out then i felt there was no choice but to put it on the top shelf with plenty of room to air out might still give up the electrical ghost but hopefully not the receiver is almost always at  volume and i capped it at  via the menus honestly its hurting my ears around  probably damaging my hearing at  this receiver pours heat out at these levels though a little concerned but no problems so far knocks on woodive also made peace with the remote i can now control my whole setup with the remote though not gracefully  update  really liking this receiver now oh the sound is so powerful and rich now imho the automated setup blows however every time ive tried it it has nearly muted my speakers and always turns the subwoofer down to nothing ive fiddled with it enough to know how to fix it now but i can see why people can be dismayed at the sound volume with the automated setup i literally thought i had broke my receiver only to find out that the automated setup turned the volume down eq probably to almost nothing screw that i disabled the automatic equalizer db level mutilation via the setup button when in whatever sound mode and several other settings i did however take the settings for distances and wrote them down with the distances right the sound was noticeably cleaner and more enjoyable after i disabled the eq mutilation and db levels being turned down so severly i was very happy why turn my subwoofer down db i couldnt even notice it was working some people may have good results with the automated sound setup but for me it made my polk speakers sound like a cheap plastic stereo undo all that crap and the sound is awesome update  i have now encountered a problem that began rather subtle on the right channels but got progressively worse it sounded like sizzling in certain voice ranges and higher frequencies thinking it was the speakers somehow i turned them on and off and swapped sides nope it was the receiver damn drove myself nuts for two days fretting on calling onkyo for support based on what i have read about peoples experiences with their support and the folks that manage their warranty work i was less than thrilled i finally reset the receiver and it seems the problem has went away hell im not sure though i almost think i can hear it still but ive become so gun shy with it that i just dont know is this receiver worth all the headaches and potential problems from hdmi issues read cheap capacitors and overheating etc to save  no way in hell is this worth  i wish very much i could go back in time and purchase the yamaha i just want something that works without the headaches it just isnt worth the hassle you may tell yourself it is but it is not in hindsight im back to wanting to throw it in the yard',\n",

       " 'bottomline for a general purpose optical pointing device the logitech g laser cordless mouse cant be beatlogitech markets the g laser cordless mouse as a gaming mouse and to that end the mouse gives the user instant access to three sensitivity levels  and  dpibefore driver installation with logitechs trademark setpoint software the user can add game detection and independent x and yaxis settings  important to me and mine  no but if you are a gamer these settings mean somethingbut since my wife does not play any games that needs the gs gaming capabilities there must be another reason i choose the mouse over all others  that reason is two or perhaps threefoldi bought the g because i wanted a cordless without the large transceiver and logitech delivered again with the g the transceiver unit is smaller than a stick of gum and plugs into any available usb port  and the g ships and is powered by with not one but two small rechargeable lithiumion batteries a little smaller than matchbook the g ships with a small charging station that not only holds the extra battery for charging whilst the other is powering the g but also provides a usb port for inserting the transceiver  sweet  this charging station in turn plugs into an available usb port preferably on the pc where is can draw more powerat first glance the g laser cordless mouse is a little unusualit is shaped much like an oval it is not shaped like any other mouse i have used in the past including the mx laser the mouse fits nicely in the hand and its size makes it easy to use its not too big and not too small  what is unique is the small thumb rest that juts out from the black and gray mouses left side its not only stylish but functionalin all other respects the g laser cordless mouse is a conventional two button mouse with a few extras thrown in for good measure  the clearest change for the mouse is the rubber scroll wheel that sits in the middle front of the mouse the scroll wheel allows you to scroll left or scroll right by tilting in one direction or another  right after the scroll wheel are two gamingcentric buttons that control the sensitivity of the mouse cursoralong the left hand side of the g laser cordless mouse are handy thumbbutton controls that allow you to page forward and backward through web pages and documents  directly after these buttons is an illuminated low level battery indicator that relays the current charge level of the included lithiumion rechargeable batteriesspeaking of the lithiumion rechargeable batteries the springloaded housing for on is located underneath the g laser cordless mouse in the rear  the battery is ejected by a small pushbutton  and speaking of button the g laser cordless mouse has another in the form of an onoff switch  however like all logitech laser pointing devices the g automatically shuts itself off during periods of inactivity again sweetinstallationinstallation the g laser cordless mouse is pretty straight forward unplug the old mouse plug in the small ghz transceiver it should be automatically detected and drivers installednote you can operate the mouse from this point on without installing the logitech software but the specialty buttons will not work however as in any standard mouse the cursor settings can be manipulated via the mouse applet in control paneli next installed the logitech setpoint software which affords me access to all of the g laser cordless mouses functionality  of course the software does its part to populate the windows xpvista system tray with a small applet that speaks to the mouse buttons if close the applet you will loose control over the specialty buttons  once this step is complete i was ready to try out my new laser mouseperformance and uselogitech makes claim that the new mx laser engine perched inside the g laser cordless mouse is many many times more sensitive than a standard red led  but because the laser tracks movement more accurately than a standard led over virtually any surface matt or glossy black or white the g takes more precise readings of the surface  the result more exact cursor movement onscreen which logitech claims makes for better gaming and graphics worki canas can my wifetestify to the g laser cordless mouses smooth movement over the display screen my wife has had g for three weeks and in that time the cursor has never jumped jittered skipped or paused  and more importantly my wife loves it and defiantly notices the difference between the g and the nottobemissed microsoft cordless it replaced  she even managed to manipulate the specialty buttons and use the mouse at the same time though she admits that this took some getting used toto date i have not had any hardware problems with the mouse or any other logitech mouse i own  nor have there been any issue with the mouse losing its connection with the transceiver  logitech suggest you place the transceiver away from other electronics good luck but if your desk is a as crowed as my wifes is this may prove impossible ie there is also a wirelessg adapter on her deskconclusionthe only issue my wife has with the mouse thus far is the lithiumion rechargeable batteries with regular useabout eight hours a dayfinds that she has to switch out the batteries every day and a half or so  however for a general purpose optical pointing device the logitech g laser cordless mouse is hard to beat  light weight and attractive the g is comfortable and easy to maneuver and far more functional than any other mouse i or my wife for that matter have ever used  the g laser guided pointing device is reliable workhorse that keeps getting better with age',\n",

       " 'background  i was in the market for a small mp player with primary usage at the gym  i was looking for a rechargeable unit as my previous player ate aaa batteries about every week or so  i considered three options of which the sansa clip was one of them  i eliminated the ipod shuffle due to its cost and lack of display  the other primary contender was the creative zen stone plus i rejected the nonplus model due it its lack of display  i will reference how the sansa clip won out throughout the rest of the reviewset up  the sansa clip is about as simple as it gets in this area  it requires no additional software installation  my home system runs xp sp with windows media player   when i plugged the player in to charge it was detected and recognized automatically  i told windows to take no action as the default behavior when the device connects  this allows me to maintain complete control over the syncing process  my unit charged in about an hourmusic transfer  you have the option of using simple drag and drop of mp files to the device as you would a usb flash drive  however using windows media player allows you the more advanced feature of playlists  since i primarily use my mp player at the gym i created multiple playlists for warm up workout and cool down  the workout lists are about  minutes while the others about  minutes  i really liked that i was able to create multiples of each for variety  right now i have three of each with about  gb still remaining to use as i please  using windows media player you can sync albums songs or playlists as you would with any other device  the sansa clip fully supports all of these options so it is a nice low effort highly functional set upsound quality  this is an area where the sansa clip is pretty impressive  i previously had the sansa m and i can tell a significant difference in sound quality  i am able to hear a lot more detail in the higher ranges such as high hat cymbals  i am using the headphones that came with the unit but i would image that higher quality headphones would sound even better  the player also has a series of preset equalizer settings for different music styles as well as one that you can customizedisplay  this is a distinguisher between the clip and the zen stone plus  the display is larger and easier to read  the mix of blue and yellow against the black background is also pleasantnavigation  the clip has a normal four button dial that is common to most small mp players  with the crisp clear display it is easy to move around and select music by artist album song or playlist  the only thing that i have noticed that doesnt work quite the way i would like is that if you navigate away from the song that is playing there doesnt seem to be a way to get back to it to see the details of whats playing  this is pretty minor though because i do not regularly navigate away from the song that is playingfm radio  this is about what you would expect from a unit with no external antenna  strong signals come in clearly but it is not going to match what you can pick up on your car stereo  this is a nice to have feature for me so it is plenty adequateoptions  as i mentioned previously my primary usage comes at the gym  i had used the song timer to measure the time between reps while lifting weights on my m  however the clip has a power saving feature that shuts off the display after  seconds by default  however you can change this to    or  seconds which should cover your needs  after adjusting mine i wake up the display after completing a set  when the display shuts off its time for the next setuse on the go  this is the other area where the clip separates itself from the zen stone plus  you can clip the player to your clothes or an arm strap i use the one that came with my m  the zen stone plus requires purchase of a separate armband accessory for an additional cost  at base price the zen stone plus and sansa clip are a push  however if you factor in another  for an armband you have a clear winner given the other advantagesconclusion  the sansa clip is now the leader in  gb small mp players  give it a spin and you wont be disappointed',\n",

process quality control at manufacturing facilities appears to be horrible customer service will probably leave you banging your head against the wall whether you get a good camera or not is more luck
